# Project Title

Using Structs

## Description

Creating my first Cadence Smart Contract for the Flow Blockchain - a practice project using Structs (containers for other data types). This particular contract depicts data about a factory building (could be expanded to capture multiple factory buildings) where the struct 'BuildingParticulars' is used to contain various details such as building color, perimeter, street of location, and the corresponding manager as may be particular to any factory.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Launch a fresh workspace in Flow Playground [here](https://play.flow.com)
* Create a new file under the 'Contracts' folder. You man name it 'FactoryData' to directly replicate this exact project or you may name it as you desire.
* Copy and paste the code content of this project's 'FactoryData.cdc' file into your newly created contract file and click on the 'deploy' button that pops up on the playgorund.
* Locate the 'Transactions' folder, create a file named similar to this project's transaction file or as may suit your purpose.
* Copy and paste the code from this project's 'UpdateFactoryData' file into your newly created transactions file.
* Look out for the input fields that pop up and fill them aappropriately, then click on the 'send' button.

### Executing program

* Locate the 'Scripts' folder. In it, create a new file named as you choose, then copy and paste the code content of this project's 'AccessFactoryData' into it.
* Look out for the input field that pops up and input the same address used as the 'manager' in transactions  above, then execute.
* Expect results to be logged unto the console below the playground. 

## Help

Ensure to identify the appropriate contract address and import in subsequent files in the right format. A closer observation of the existing contracts on the Flow playground will throw more light on how to achieve this.
